# patch_antenna

In this section, we will design a patch antenna according to Figure 1.2 at a frequency of f_0, as specified in the provided table. You should consider the initial dimensions of the antenna at the desired frequency, initially using the formula W = λ/4, where λ is calculated at the given frequency. If the frequency of the antenna is not correct after simulation, you will need to adjust the dimensions, particularly the width (W) of the patch.

Use 4003RO as the substrate material with the same parameters as given earlier. The input impedance of the antenna is 50 ohms.

Simulation Steps:
Design the patch antenna as per the provided specifications using simulation software.

Create a report with the schematic of the designed antenna.

Simulate the antenna and optimize the structure for a bandwidth of 200 MHz such that S11 is less than -10 dB within this bandwidth.

Plot the magnitude of S11 for the optimized structure within a frequency range of 1 GHz centered around the resonance frequency.

Create a 3D plot of the realized gain pattern of the antenna in dB for the optimized structure. The plotting range should be from -10 dB to 10 dB.

Plot the realized gain pattern of the antenna in two planes: φ = 0 and φ = 90 degrees. The range for plotting should be from -10 dB to 10 dB.

Animate the electric field pattern of the antenna on the ground plane.

Plot the axial ratio of the antenna (the ratio of vertical to horizontal polarization) on the θ = 0 plane. Determine the polarization type: linear or circular.

Please follow the provided instructions carefully, perform the simulation, and report the results for each task.
